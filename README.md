# Shop

This is a project that simulates a online shop. It has an API that lists the products and has a frontend that shows the products and lets you add them to the cart. The checkout is not working currently.

## Overview

The API is made with nodejs with hapi. The web is made with NextJS, React and Typescript. You can read more about each in `apps/api/README.md` or `apps/web/README.md`

## Get started

```
git clone https://github.com/madewithlove/technical-assignment-full-stack-engineer-velkan14.git

# Technical assignment full-stack engineer

Youâ€™re working on an online shopping platform. The sales team wants to know which items were added to a basket, but removed before checkout. We will use this data later for targeted discounts.

Build a shopping basket that helps you get this data. You are free to use the languages, frameworks and tools you prefer.

You have 1 week to accomplish the assignment. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but one of our colleagues tends to say: "Make sure it is good" ;-).
